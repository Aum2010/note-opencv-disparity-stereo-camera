## Stereo Disparity Map Generation Pipeline

This README describes the process for computing a disparity map from a pair of stereo images using OpenCV. The pipeline involves camera calibration, image undistortion, keypoint matching, image rectification, and disparity map calculation using StereoSGBM.

## Step-by-Step Summary

### 1. **Load Camera Calibration Parameters**

From `camera_parameter.npz`, the following parameters are loaded:

* `mtx`: Camera intrinsic matrix
* `dist`: Distortion coefficients
* `rvecs` and `tvecs`: Rotation and translation vectors (not used directly)

### 2. **Load Stereo Images**

Stereo pair images (e.g., `13.png` and `14.png`) are read in grayscale mode.

### 3. **Undistortion**

Using OpenCV's `cv.getOptimalNewCameraMatrix` and `cv.undistort`, images are corrected for lens distortion.

### 4. **Feature Detection and Matching**

* Uses `SIFT` for keypoint detection and description.
* Matches keypoints using `BFMatcher` with `cv.NORM_L1`.
* Only top 5% matches are kept.

### 5. **Homography Estimation and Rectification**

* Estimate homography matrix `H` using `cv.findHomography` and RANSAC.
* Apply perspective warp to the right image to align it with the left.

### 6. **Overlap Area Extraction**

* Mask both images to retain only overlapping regions.
* Extract valid regions for both left and rectified right images.

### 7. **Disparity Calculation**

* Uses `cv.StereoSGBM_create` with customized parameters.
* Outputs a floating point disparity image with invalid regions set to NaN.

### 8. **Visualization and Saving**

* Saves intermediate images: undistorted images, keypoints, matches, rectified right image, and the final disparity map.

## Dependencies

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib
```

## üê≥ Run with Docker

You can use a pre-built Docker image with OpenCV:

```bash
docker run -it -v $PWD/workspace:/workspace hdgigante/python-opencv:4.11.0-ubuntu /bin/bash
```

## Notes

* Ensure `camera_parameter.npz` exists in the calibration folder.
* All steps save visual outputs for verification.
* The disparity image may need post-processing (e.g., filtering) for improved accuracy.
